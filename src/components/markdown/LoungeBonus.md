Whenever you take a break in the Old Library, where do you usually like to go? The main lobbey, the studio lounge, or even one of the computer rooms? While the chairs, couches and sofas are comfortable, wouldn't you like to sleep on a nice, comfy, mattress? My plan is to renovate the studio lounge, moving the desks and putting sleek twin size beds in their place. An important part of design is the brainstorming process. Being able o be creative and productive requires you to be well rested, which can easily be done with these beds. And when you wake up from your nap, you'll have an automatic pancake maker near you to make you breakfast, giving you the energy you need to start designing. As a result, the lounge becomes more welcoming, allowing students to work, rest, and have a convenient source of food.
