I'm sure I already have you sold on this idea, but a few are probably still wondering, **"how exactly will the automatic pancake maker work?"** The pancake maker will be tied to every students' ID. **Twice a day**, students will be able to have their ID scanned by the pancake maker, which will cause them machine to create 2 pancakes for them (_up to four pancakes per day_). This will not cost students dining dollars in order to use it. There is no cooldown between the times that students can use their scans, except for when they use both of their scans, they will then have to wait until the following day to get their scans back. 

Next to the pancake maker will be some options students may add to their pancake:
-Maple syrup
-Whipped cream
-chocolate chips
-blueberries
