I'm sure I already have you sold on this idea, but a few of you are probably still wondering, **"how exactly will the automatic pancake maker work?"** The automatic pancake maker will have a scanner that will be tied to every students' ID. **Twice a day**, students will be able to have their ID scanned by the pancake maker, which will cause them machine to create 2 pancakes for them (_up to four pancakes per day_). This will not cost students dining dollars in order to use it. There is no cooldown between the times that students can use their scans, except for when they use both of their scans, they will then have to wait until the following day to get their scans back. The following options will be next to the pancake maker that students may add to their pancake.
